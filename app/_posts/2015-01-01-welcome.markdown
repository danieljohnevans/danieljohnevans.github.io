This site has been in the making for awhile now. Actually it lived and died in Wordpress for a brief period last fall and is finally live via Jekyll.

I’m using this blog to record my thoughts and projects specifically as they relate to my explorations in digital history. I think it’ll be useful to have a place to write down my blunders and (hopefully) get feedback from the larger DH community.

All the best –
