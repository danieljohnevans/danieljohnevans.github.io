                    Hi! My name is Dan. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm the Digital Humanities Developer at Carnegie Mellon University. 

                    Prior to that I was producing text / data mining toolkits, as well as, digital archive collections at EBSCO Information Services. I'm very interested in data visualizations, digital archives, digital preservation, digital humanities, information retrieval, machine learning, natural language processing, and textual analysis. I also get overly excited about 20th-century Russian history, road biking, and riding a snowboard. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I graduated from the College of the Holy Cross and since then have worked on a farm in Central Massachusetts, a mountain in Colorado, and as a community organizer. Currently, I'm based out of Pittsburgh, PA.
