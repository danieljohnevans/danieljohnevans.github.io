Earlier this spring I worked with Wendy Woloson, an Assistant Professor of History at Rutgers Camden, to geocode and map the locations of EBSCO's *American Antiquarian Society Periodicals Collections.* She was preparing to give a presentation at the Research Society of American Periodicals conference in May of 2015. Those visualizations, in conjunction with a social network analysis markup I created last fall, became the foundation for a blog post I wrote earlier this month.

It was recently featured on EBSCO's marketing page. In the post, I broadly speak about the digital humanities. I also touch upon some of text and data mining projects I'm currently working on.

Because the images are small on the blog, I've included a zoomed in version of New England below:

Please feel free to reach out if you'd like a larger copy of the entire United States or would like a bit more background regarding the social network analysis.
