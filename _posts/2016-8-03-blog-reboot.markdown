Hello again.

It's been over a year and here I am reviving this site from the dead.

These posts going forward are to act as notebook entries rather than blog posts. They are mean to function as a way for me to document my work and interests so that I (and hopefully others) may return to it at a later date. Additionally, it will provide me (and hopefully others) with documentation for working through problems or areas of interest.

As such, I may work through various tutorials, books, or problems on here. Similarly, I may post and document my code as I work through issues. I may in the future put up other writing materials.

Anyway I want to keep this short so I can actually get to the hacks.

DJE
