<p>So I feel that I should add a few technical notes to this blog now that this is off the ground. As alluded to in my first post a few months ago, this site has gone through a few different iterations. It began with a Wordpress.org account. However, that was quickly abandoned when I realized that for my purposes the features of a full blown WAMP/MAMP environment weren't necessary.</p>

<p>Instead I needed something lighter, easier to maintain and, in my opinion, a lot more fun to customize. I had heard that Bootstrap provided many of those features. So while Boston slowly dug itself out earlier this year, I spent some time building out a single page site using the Bootstrap API. In fact, some of what you see on the "about" page comes from that exercise. </p>

<p> However, once I discovered <a href="http://jekyllbootstrap.com/">Jekyll Bootstrap</a> earlier this weekend, I knew I was sold on a framework. Jekyll Bootstrap allows an end user to quickly build out a blogging platform. It is lightweight, easy to deploy, fully customizable and, as an added bonus, hosts freely on Github. I've gotten a website off the ground within the past few days. </p>

<p>Now I can focus on blogging rather than maintaining a website.</p>

<p>stay tuned.</p>
