I moved to Somerville from the North Shore in September. While I’m still working on the North Shore, my commute has invariably risen from a seemingly quick 30 minute car ride to a 1.5 to 2 hour subway-to-commuter-rail marathon.

I’ve started reading. A lot.

Since January 2014, I’ve read:

To be honest, I read most of these books this fall. I loved Candice Millard’s writing. Her ideas and sentences flowed seamlessly. I’ve recommended her to a few friends and even those who aren’t usually fans of popular history are really blown away by her captivating style. I was pleasantly surprised to see her interviewed on Ken Burns’ Roosevelts.

I feel that I should also note that I’ve gone on a bit of a short story kick. I struggled to put down the works of Carver, Munro, and Saunders.

Not recorded here are the countless times I spent picking up, and putting down, `Infinite Jest`. I just can’t seem to commit to that book. I feel like I’ll pick it up and get into it only to read a review or receive a recommendation and drop it for something more approachable. There’s so many other things I’m dying to read. Maybe I’ll go on a media blackout in 2015 and just force myself through it.
