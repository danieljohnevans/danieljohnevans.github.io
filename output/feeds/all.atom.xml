## Documentation &amp; Data Management

Documentation and data management might seem trivial or boring topics, but in actuality, they are crucial to the success of any project. Without proper documentation, it can be difficult to understand what you did, why you did it, and how you did it. This can lead to confusion, errors, and ultimately a lack of reproducibility.

Now reproducibility is not a topic we've discussed much in class, and that's because while movements like Open Science and Open Data are gaining traction, they are still relatively new to the humanities. In particular, it's not always clear what reproducibility means for cultural data.

For example, in the course, we've had multiple moments where we have seen how our interpretation shapes the data we create and how we analyze it. This means that even if we share our data and code, it might not be possible to reproduce our results exactly. This is not a bad thing, but it does mean we need to be thoughtful about how we document our work and the audience we are trying to reach.

I particularly like the following figure and guidelines from the *Turing Way*:

&lt;/figure&gt;

Which shows documentation as being analogous to helping people find their way in a dark forest, so sort of like a lamp or a map. The guidelines they provide for documentation are also quite useful, [https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/rdm/rdm-metadata.html](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/rdm/rdm-metadata.html):

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

You'll notice they have a number of suggestions, some of which might be particularly useful for your final projects. For example, making sure you have a README.md in your GitHub repository, or creating a data dictionary or a codebook to help explain your data.

In addition to their suggestions for documentation, the *Turing Way* also has some guidelines for how to best format and share data. In particular, they build from Karl Broman and Kara Woo's [Data Organization in Spreadsheets](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2017.1375989) suggestions for how to best format your data in a spreadsheet, which include the following:

- **Save Interoperable Formats.** This means saving your data in a format that can be easily read by other software, like CSV or TSV. This can help avoid issues with proprietary formats like Excel, which can sometimes cause problems when sharing data.
- **Make Backups**. This means saving your data in multiple locations, so you don't lose it if something goes wrong.
- **Avoid Non-Data Content**. This means avoiding color coding, merged cells, and other formatting that might make it difficult to read your data or use the data programmatically.
- **Be consistent**. That means using the same units, the same date format, the same spelling, etc. One option is to use a data dictionary or codebook to help explain your data, especially for things like categorical variables.
- **Choose good names for things**. That means using descriptive names for your columns and rows.
- **Write dates as YYYY-MM-DD**. This is the international standard for dates and can help avoid confusion.
- **No empty cells**. If you don't have data, use a placeholder like `NA` or `NULL`, but try to avoid empty cells in how you format and organize your data. Also though if you have missing data, be sure to document that and be thoughtful about how you handle it. For example, you might want to use a placeholder like `NA` or `NULL` to indicate missing data, rather than just leaving a cell blank which could be interpreted as a zero by some software.
- **Put just one thing in a cell**. This means avoiding merged cells, and trying to keep your data organized in a way that makes it easy to read and understand.
- **Make it a rectangle**. This means avoiding having data in the header or footer of your spreadsheet, and trying to keep your data in a rectangular shape.

&lt;/figure&gt;

These are general guidelines that can help you format, organize, and document your data and code in a way that makes it easier to share and understand. This is crucial for preserving your work and making it accessible to others. But most importantly, I would encourage you to think of documentation as a chance to share both your interpretative choices and articulate the principles that you want others to follow when engaging with and using your materials. --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we will be creating applying the priciples of minimal computing to digital publishing. This is where we take projects, a resume, or a blog, and share it with the world. There are many ways to do this, from creating a website (which we will be doing today), to publishing a paper, to sharing your data on a repository. There's also a number of considerations that should inform how we publish our work, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Audience&lt;/strong&gt;. Who are you trying to reach with your work? Are you trying to reach other scholars, the general public, or a specific community?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accessibility&lt;/strong&gt;. How can you make your work accessible to the widest possible audience? This might mean making your work open access, or providing alternative formats for people with disabilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interactivity&lt;/strong&gt;. How can you make your work more engaging and interactive? This might mean using multimedia, or creating interactive visualizations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sustainability&lt;/strong&gt;. How can you ensure that your work will be preserved and accessible in the future? This might mean using open standards, or depositing your work in a repository.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Politics/Ethics&lt;/strong&gt;. How can you ensure that your work is ethical and responsible? How does our choice of technologies or infrastructures build-in certain ethical and political commitments? This might mean obtaining informed consent, or protecting the privacy of your subjects. It might also mean thinking about how your work might be used in the future, and how you can ensure that it is used responsibly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no one-answer to these questions, but they are important to consider as you think about how to publish your work. In this class, we will focus on one way to publish your work, which is creating a website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Publishing with GitHub Pages &amp;amp; Static Site Generators&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hosting HTML Pages with GitHub Pages
While we have primarily been using GitHub for its versioning and collaboration features, it also has a feature called GitHub Pages that allows you to host static websites for free. This is a great way to share your work with others, and to learn more about how the web works. We will be building static web sites later this semester, but to get our feet wet, we can start by hosting our HTML pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to Host HTML Pages with GitHub Pages
First, you need to create a new repository on GitHub. You can do this by clicking the &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; in the top right corner and selecting &lt;code&gt;New Repository&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a user on GitHub, you can create a custom website that is hosted on GitHub Pages. This is a great option for creating a personal website, or a website for a project. This website is hosted at the github.io domain name so you don't have to pay for a domain name. However, to make this domain you need to create a repository with a specific name: your username. So for example, my GitHub username is danieljohnevans so I need to create a repository called danieljohnevans.github.io to generate my website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="My Image" src="https://lucianli123.github.io/is310-culture-as-data-2024/assets/images/githubio_repo.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you create your repository, you need to make sure it is Public and you can add a README.md (though that is optional).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="image" src="https://lucianli123.github.io/is310-culture-as-data-2024/assets/images/create_new_file.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have your repository, the next step is to add some web files. The most basic file you can add is an &lt;code&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://lucianli123.github.io/is310-culture-as-data-2024/assets/images/create_index_html.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you've created your &lt;code&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt; file, you can either leave it blank or add some HTML code. Now the key thing is to remember to commit your HTML page. Remember committing is how we save things on GitHub. So you can either commit via the command line with your VS Code Terminal or via the GitHub website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, GitHub should start automatically hosting your website at &lt;code&gt;https://yourusername.github.io.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll notice you don't need to configure any Actions (though you can for HTML), and that's because this is a special type of repository on GitHub, so any HTML files you add will automatically be hosted but that will not happen in other repos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can still see how GitHub is deploying your site by clicking on the tab called Actions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="image" src="https://lucianli123.github.io/is310-culture-as-data-2024/assets/images/actions_tab.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should see some green lines and checks, all of which indicates your site is live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="image" src="https://lucianli123.github.io/is310-culture-as-data-2024/assets/images/live_website.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find see this live here https://danieljohnevans.github.io/.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a great way to share your work, but it can be a bit limiting if you want to create a more complex website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the more popular approaches that we learned about in our readings on minimal computing is to use &lt;strong&gt;static site generators&lt;/strong&gt;. The term "static site" refers to a website that is made up of HTML files, rather than being generated dynamically by a server. This means that the site is faster, more secure, and easier to host than a dynamic site, but it also means that it can be more difficult to update and maintain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;a href="https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ssg-comparison-cheatsheet.png?resize=3699%2C1332&amp;ssl=1"&gt;
    &lt;img src="https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ssg-comparison-cheatsheet.png?resize=3699%2C1332&amp;ssl=1" class="image-popup"&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see from this figure, there are a number of static site generators available, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Some of the most popular options include Jekyll, Hugo, and Gatsby, but there are many others to choose from, and essentially most modern programming languages have one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core thing to know is that almost every static site generator works in the same way: you write your content in Markdown, you run a command to build your site, and then you host the resulting HTML files on the web. In this lesson, we will be exploring how to use the Pelican static site generator to create a website, but you can use any static site generator you like. Part of how you might select a static site generator is based on the programming language you are most comfortable with, as well as the features you need for your site. Furthermore, you might consider the pre-built themes and plugins that are available for each static site generator, as well as the community support and documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Creating a Pelican Site&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pelican is a static site generator that is built in the programming language Python. You can see the documentation for Pelican here &lt;a href="https://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/"&gt;https://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/&lt;/a&gt; and the GitHub repo here &lt;a href="https://github.com/getpelican/pelican"&gt;https://github.com/getpelican/pelican&lt;/a&gt;. Pelican is less popular than some other static site generators in Computing in the Humanities (for example, this course website is built in a different one called Jekyll), but it is a good option if you are already familiar with Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To create a new Pelican site, we need to follow the instructions in the documentation &lt;a href="https://docs.getpelican.com/en/latest/quickstart.html"&gt;https://docs.getpelican.com/en/latest/quickstart.html&lt;/a&gt;. Which tells us that first we need to activate our virtual environment and install Pelican, along with the Markdown library. We can do this with the following commands (though remember to replace your correct virtual environment name):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Macbook/Linux/WSL:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;conda&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;activate&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;YOUR&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;ENVIRONMENT&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;is&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;it&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;is310?&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
pip&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;install&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;pelican&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;markdown
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For PowerShell:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;conda&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;activate&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;YOUR&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;ENVIRONMENT&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;is&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;it&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;is310?&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
pip&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;install&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;pelican&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;markdown
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, we need to make sure we are in our correct directory and also create folder for our new site. You are welcome to try making this directory in your &lt;code&gt;is310-coding-assignments&lt;/code&gt; folder, but I would recommend creating this site in your GitHub username folder, so that you can easily host it on GitHub Pages (so that would be the &lt;code&gt;username.github.io&lt;/code&gt; folder).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you are in the correct folder and have everything installed, you can run the following command to create a new Pelican site:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;pelican-quickstart
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will ask you a series of questions about your site, including the title, the author, and the URL. In our case, we will  give it the following answers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="pelican_answers" src="images/pelican_answers.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can name your site whatever you like, but I would recommend using your GitHub username so that you can easily host it on GitHub Pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These answers will create a new Pelican site with the following structure:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;content/
output/
tasks.py
Makefile
pelicanconf.py
publishconf.py
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don't need to memorize this structure but it's good to know that the &lt;code&gt;content&lt;/code&gt; directory is where you will put your Markdown files, the &lt;code&gt;output&lt;/code&gt; directory is where your HTML files will be generated, and the &lt;code&gt;pelicanconf.py&lt;/code&gt; file is where you can configure your site. So for example, if we wanted to change the name of our website or its url, we could do that in the &lt;code&gt;pelicanconf.py&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="pelicanconf" src="https://zoeleblanc.com/is310-computing-humanities-spring-2024/assets/images/pelican_conf.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we have the folder open in VS Code and we can also try adding some content. For example, we can create a new Markdown file, named &lt;code&gt;my-first-post.md&lt;/code&gt;, in the &lt;code&gt;content&lt;/code&gt; directory:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;Title: My First Post

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we save that file, we can start using the static site generator to build our website with the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;pelican&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;content
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will generate a series of HTML files in the &lt;code&gt;output&lt;/code&gt; directory, which we can then serve locally from our computer using the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;pelican&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;--listen&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;--autoreload
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should see the following in your terminal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="terminal" src="https://zoeleblanc.com/is310-computing-humanities-spring-2024/assets/images/pelican_serve.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then when you click on the link &lt;code&gt;http://localhost:8000/&lt;/code&gt;, you should see your new site:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="first_look" src="https://zoeleblanc.com/is310-computing-humanities-spring-2024/assets/images/pelican_site.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember when we discussed IP addresses and domain names? This &lt;code&gt;localhost&lt;/code&gt; is essentially the IP address for your computer, and the &lt;code&gt;8000&lt;/code&gt; is the port number. So when you click on that link, you are essentially telling your web browser to look for the website on your computer. This is a great way to test your site before you publish it to the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As long as everything is working, you should see your new site in the browser. We can also explore the HTML files in the &lt;code&gt;output&lt;/code&gt; directory to see how Pelican has converted our Markdown file into a series of HTML files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="pelican_output" src="https://zoeleblanc.com/is310-computing-humanities-spring-2024/assets/images/pelican_output.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can also update our Markdown post to include more content, like an image or a code block:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;Title: My First Post
Date: 2024-04-17
Category: Python
Tags: pelican, python
Slug: my-first-post
Authors: Daniel Evans

This is my first post using Pelican!

Adding some more content here, like an image:

![&lt;span class="nt"&gt;Python logo&lt;/span&gt;](&lt;span class="na"&gt;https://www.python.org/static/community_logos/python-logo-master-v3-TM.png&lt;/span&gt;)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now when we save the file, our server should automatically update and we can see the new content in the browser:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="pelican_site" src="https://zoeleblanc.com/is310-computing-humanities-spring-2024/assets/images/pelican_image.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our next step might be adding more pages or posts to our site, or we could also explore customizing the theme. Pelican comes with a number of pre-built themes, but you can also create your own theme or modify an existing one. You can find more information about how to do this in the Pelican documentation &lt;a href="https://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/themes.html"&gt;https://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/themes.html&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Adding Pages &amp;amp; Files to Pelican&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To add a new page to your Pelican site, you can create a new Markdown file in the &lt;code&gt;content&lt;/code&gt; directory. For example, you could create a new file called &lt;code&gt;about.md&lt;/code&gt; with the following content:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;Title: About
Date: 2024-04-17


This is the about page. It&amp;#39;s a great place to tell your visitors about your site, your goals, and your story. You can edit this page by opening the /content/pages/about.md file.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you save the file, you can rebuild your site with the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;pelican&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;content
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then you can rebuild your site with the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;pelican&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;--listen&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;--autoreload
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should see the new page in your browser when you click on the link &lt;code&gt;http://localhost:8000/about.html&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="about" src="https://zoeleblanc.com/is310-computing-humanities-spring-2024/assets/images/pelican_about.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- We might also want to change the links at the bottom of our page to include the course website. We can do this by editing the `pelicanconf.py` file and specifically the LINKS section:


&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Blogroll&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;LINKS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Pelican&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;https://getpelican.com/&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Python.org&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;https://www.python.org/&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Jinja2&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;https://palletsprojects.com/p/jinja/&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;You can modify those links in your config file&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;#&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



We can change the last link to point to the course website, like so:


&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Blogroll&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;LINKS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;A Course Project&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;#&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;IS310 Course Website&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;https://zoeleblanc.com/is310-computing-humanities-2024/&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



Now we can see the new link in the footer of our site:

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/pelican_links.png"&gt;
    &lt;img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/pelican_links.png" class="image-popup"&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

In addition to adding pages or tweaking links, we can also create a new folder in our `content` folder to store files or images we might want to use in our site. For example, we could create a new folder called `assets` and then within that we can add a new folder called `images` and one called `files`. In images, we could save our Python Logo file called `python-logo.png`. We can then reference this image in our Markdown files like so:


&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;![&lt;span class="nt"&gt;Python logo&lt;/span&gt;](&lt;span class="na"&gt;/assets/images/python-logo.png&lt;/span&gt;)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



One of the key things we need to change though is also in our `pelicanconf.py` file, where we need to tell Pelican to copy the `assets` folder to the `output` folder. We can do this by adding the following line to bottom of the file:


&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;STATIC_PATHS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;assets/images&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;assets/files&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



This will tell Pelican to copy the `assets` folder to the `output` folder when it builds the site. This is important because otherwise, the images or files won't be available when you publish your site.

So now when we refresh our site, we should still see our image but if we inspect the page, we should see that the image is being loaded from the `assets` folder, rather than the initial URL:

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/pelican_python_logo.png"&gt;
    &lt;img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/pelican_python_logo.png" class="image-popup"&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

We can read more about linking to static content in the documentation [https://docs.getpelican.com/en/latest/content.html#linking-to-static-files](https://docs.getpelican.com/en/latest/content.html#linking-to-static-files). Now that we are starting to get a sense of how everything works together, we can start to think about how we might customize our site further. --&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Customizing the Theme&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the main values of using a static site generator, beyond the ones we've already discussed, is that it comes with pre-built themes that you can use to style your site. In the case of Pelican, we can see what themes are available by running the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;pelican-themes&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-l
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will list all the themes we have currently installed. But we can also take a look at curated lists of available themes that we could install. To do that we can visit, the Pelican Themes preview site &lt;a href="https://pelicanthemes.com/"&gt;https://pelicanthemes.com/&lt;/a&gt; and take a look at what is available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Documentation on how to update a theme is below, however, in the interest of time, we will use the simple theme with some minor CSS tweaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First we will change to the &lt;code&gt;simple&lt;/code&gt; pelican theme in order to remove any styling. In &lt;code&gt;pelicanconf.py&lt;/code&gt; we select this theme by adding the line:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;THEME = 'simple'&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon reloading the page, we see that all stylistic features are removed and we are left with plain black text on a white background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's add some color. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href="https://github.com/dbohdan/classless-css"&gt;github page&lt;/a&gt; lists a number of classless CSS themes and frameworks that will work with Pelican's simple theme&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd recommend checking out a few demos and trying out a few themes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To implement a theme, go to a particular repository:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="classless_repo" src="/images/classless_repo.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then scroll down until you find list of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network"&gt;CDN&lt;/a&gt; URLS:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="classless_css" src="/images/classless_css.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NOTE: If the CDN link is not in the repo then it may in be in the demo:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="demo" src="/images/demo.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choose the URL that is most fitting for your project. Copy and paste the CDN link into &lt;code&gt;pelicanconf.py&lt;/code&gt; as seen below.  In this instance, I am using the &lt;a href="https://github.com/dbohdan/classless-css?tab=readme-ov-file#holidaycss"&gt;holiday theme&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;STYLESHEET_URL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/holiday.css@0.11.2&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Publishing Your Site with GitHub Pages&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we are happy with our site, we can publish it to the web using GitHub Pages. We have already used GitHub Pages to make our static HTML pages available on the web, but we can also use it to host more complex sites like the one we've created with Pelican.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now to do this we can either publish our site as our username.github.io site, or we can publish it as a project site. The difference is that the username.github.io site is a personal site that is available at &lt;code&gt;https://username.github.io&lt;/code&gt;, while a project site is available at &lt;code&gt;https://username.github.io/project-name&lt;/code&gt;. I would recommend publishing our site as a project site, so that we can keep our username.github.io site for those wanting to learn about us, but you can use either option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To publish our site as a project site, we need to create a new repository on GitHub with the name that we want to use for our site. For example, I could create a new repository called &lt;code&gt;is310-example-project&lt;/code&gt;. Once we have created the repository, we now need to add our SITEURL to our &lt;code&gt;pelicanconf.py&lt;/code&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;SITEURL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;https://danieljohnevans.github.io/&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are not creating a project page, then you can just use &lt;code&gt;SITEURL = 'https://username.github.io'&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we should generate our site one last time with the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;pelican&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;content&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-o&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;output&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-s&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;publishconf.py&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-t&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;simple
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These flags tell Pelican to build the site using the &lt;code&gt;publishconf.py&lt;/code&gt; file, which is a configuration file that tells Pelican to optimize the site for production, and to use the &lt;code&gt;simple&lt;/code&gt; theme. This will generate a series of HTML files in the &lt;code&gt;output&lt;/code&gt; directory that we can now copy to our new repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we will change our directory to the &lt;code&gt;output&lt;/code&gt; folder and then initialize a new git repository in that folder:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;output
git&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;init
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we need to add all the files in the folder to the repository and commit them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;git&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;add&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;.
git&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;commit&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-m&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Initial commit&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we need to add the remote repository to our local repository:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;git&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;remote&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;add&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;origin&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;git@github.com:ZoeLeBlanc/is310-example-project.git
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we can push our site to the remote repository:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;git&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;push&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-u&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;origin&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;main
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we have pushed our site to the remote repository, we can go to the repository on GitHub and go to the settings tab. Then we can scroll down to the GitHub Pages section and select the &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; branch as the source for our site. We can also choose a theme for our site, and then we can see our site live on the web at &lt;code&gt;https://username.github.io/project-name&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see an example, I've created for our class &lt;a href="http://zoeleblanc.com/is310-example-project/"&gt;http://zoeleblanc.com/is310-example-project/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How to install a pre-built theme&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can go to the Pelican Themes GitHub repository &lt;a href="https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes"&gt;https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes&lt;/a&gt;, where we can find the theme we want as a submodule. According to the documentation, the easiest way to install one of these themes is to clone the full pelican-themes repository in a new directory:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;git&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;clone&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;--recursive&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;~/pelican-themes
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now this will create a new directory called &lt;code&gt;pelican-themes&lt;/code&gt; in your home directory, which you can then navigate to and see all the themes available. You can then install the theme you want by running the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;pelican-themes&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;--install&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;~/pelican-themes/waterspill
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I would recommend creating a &lt;code&gt;themes&lt;/code&gt; directory in your Pelican site and then copying &lt;strong&gt;just&lt;/strong&gt; the theme you want into that directory. This way you can keep your theme separate from the Pelican themes repository and it will be easier to manage. So for example, I want the &lt;code&gt;waterspill&lt;/code&gt; theme, so I've copied that folder into my &lt;code&gt;themes&lt;/code&gt; folder, which is my Pelican site directory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, I need to add a new line to my &lt;code&gt;pelicanconf.py&lt;/code&gt; file to tell Pelican to use the new theme. I can do this by adding the following line to the file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;THEME&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;themes/waterspill&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I can recompile my site with the new theme by running the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;pelican&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;content&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-t&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;themes/waterspill
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then I can serve my site with the new theme by running the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;pelican&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;--listen&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;--autoreload
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which should give us the following in our browser:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="watercolor" src="https://zoeleblanc.com/is310-computing-humanities-spring-2024/assets/images/pelican_waterspill.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we have a new theme, we can start to explore how to customize it further. We can do this by editing the &lt;code&gt;base.html&lt;/code&gt; file in the theme directory. This file is the main template for the site, and it controls the layout and styling of the site. We can edit this file to change the colors, fonts, and layout of the site, as well as to add new features like a navigation bar or a footer.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry></feed>
