The figure above is from [The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/welcome.html), a community-driven book project that aims to provide a comprehensive guide to reproducible, ethical, inclusive, and collaborative data science, especially for those working with cultural data. I would highly recommend checking out their resources if you are interested in learning more about these topics.

## Documentation & Data Management

Documentation and data management might seem trivial or boring topics, but in actuality, they are crucial to the success of any project. Without proper documentation, it can be difficult to understand what you did, why you did it, and how you did it. This can lead to confusion, errors, and ultimately a lack of reproducibility.

Now reproducibility is not a topic we've discussed much in class, and that's because while movements like Open Science and Open Data are gaining traction, they are still relatively new to the humanities. In particular, it's not always clear what reproducibility means for cultural data.

For example, in the course, we've had multiple moments where we have seen how our interpretation shapes the data we create and how we analyze it. This means that even if we share our data and code, it might not be possible to reproduce our results exactly. This is not a bad thing, but it does mean we need to be thoughtful about how we document our work and the audience we are trying to reach.

I particularly like the following figure and guidelines from the *Turing Way*:

</figure>

Which shows documentation as being analogous to helping people find their way in a dark forest, so sort of like a lamp or a map. The guidelines they provide for documentation are also quite useful, [https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/rdm/rdm-metadata.html](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/rdm/rdm-metadata.html):

    </a>
</figure>

You'll notice they have a number of suggestions, some of which might be particularly useful for your final projects. For example, making sure you have a README.md in your GitHub repository, or creating a data dictionary or a codebook to help explain your data.

In addition to their suggestions for documentation, the *Turing Way* also has some guidelines for how to best format and share data. In particular, they build from Karl Broman and Kara Woo's [Data Organization in Spreadsheets](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2017.1375989) suggestions for how to best format your data in a spreadsheet, which include the following:

- **Save Interoperable Formats.** This means saving your data in a format that can be easily read by other software, like CSV or TSV. This can help avoid issues with proprietary formats like Excel, which can sometimes cause problems when sharing data.
- **Make Backups**. This means saving your data in multiple locations, so you don't lose it if something goes wrong.
- **Avoid Non-Data Content**. This means avoiding color coding, merged cells, and other formatting that might make it difficult to read your data or use the data programmatically.
- **Be consistent**. That means using the same units, the same date format, the same spelling, etc. One option is to use a data dictionary or codebook to help explain your data, especially for things like categorical variables.
- **Choose good names for things**. That means using descriptive names for your columns and rows.
- **Write dates as YYYY-MM-DD**. This is the international standard for dates and can help avoid confusion.
- **No empty cells**. If you don't have data, use a placeholder like `NA` or `NULL`, but try to avoid empty cells in how you format and organize your data. Also though if you have missing data, be sure to document that and be thoughtful about how you handle it. For example, you might want to use a placeholder like `NA` or `NULL` to indicate missing data, rather than just leaving a cell blank which could be interpreted as a zero by some software.
- **Put just one thing in a cell**. This means avoiding merged cells, and trying to keep your data organized in a way that makes it easy to read and understand.
- **Make it a rectangle**. This means avoiding having data in the header or footer of your spreadsheet, and trying to keep your data in a rectangular shape.

These are general guidelines that can help you format, organize, and document your data and code in a way that makes it easier to share and understand. This is crucial for preserving your work and making it accessible to others. But most importantly, I would encourage you to think of documentation as a chance to share both your interpretative choices and articulate the principles that you want others to follow when engaging with and using your materials. -->
